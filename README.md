# getINNOtized Recommendation System

A comprehensive recommendation system that leverages user behavior and preferences to provide personalized suggestions across multiple domains including e-commerce, media, and subscription services.

## Project Overview

This recommendation system analyzes user interactions, preferences, and behavioral patterns to generate personalized recommendations. The system implements multiple recommendation algorithms and provides comprehensive analytics to understand user behavior and optimize recommendation performance.

## Features

### Recommendation Algorithms
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-based recommendations using similarity metrics
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommendations based on item properties and metadata
- **Popularity-Based**: Recommendations based on overall item popularity
- **Category-Based**: Recommendations within user's preferred categories
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple algorithms for optimal results

### Analytics & Insights
- User behavior analysis and segmentation
- Temporal pattern analysis (hourly, daily, weekly patterns)
- Recommendation quality evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Item popularity and category analysis
- Cross-category interaction patterns

## Data Structure

The system works with the following data files:
- `events.csv`: User interaction events (timestamp, visitorid, event, itemid, transactionid)
- `category_tree.csv`: Category hierarchy (categoryid, parentid)
- `item_properties_part1.1.csv` & `item_properties_part2.csv`: Item metadata and properties

## Installation

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure all data files are in the project directory

## Usage

Run the recommendation system:
```bash
python Recommendation_system.py
```

## Analytical Questions

The system addresses 10 key analytical questions:

1. **Popular Items & Categories**: What are the most popular items and categories based on user interactions?
2. **Temporal Patterns**: How do user behavior patterns vary across different time periods?
3. **Algorithm Effectiveness**: What is the effectiveness of different recommendation algorithms?
4. **Engagement Correlation**: How do user engagement levels correlate with recommendation personalization?
5. **Category Preferences**: What are the category preferences and cross-category interaction patterns?
6. **User Segmentation**: How do new vs. returning users differ in their interaction patterns?
7. **Recommendation Diversity**: What is the impact of recommendation diversity on user satisfaction?
8. **Item Properties**: How do item properties and metadata influence recommendation performance?
9. **Optimal List Lengths**: What are the optimal recommendation list lengths for different user segments?
10. **External Factors**: How do external factors (time, season, events) affect recommendation performance?

## Key Metrics

The system tracks and analyzes:
- **Precision**: Accuracy of recommendations
- **Recall**: Coverage of user preferences
- **F1 Score**: Balanced measure of recommendation quality
- **Diversity**: Variety in recommended items
- **Novelty**: Introduction of new items to users
- **Engagement Rates**: User interaction with recommendations
- **Conversion Rates**: Success of recommendations in driving actions
